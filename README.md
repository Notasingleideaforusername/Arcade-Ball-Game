# Arcade-Ball-Game
Is it fun? I'm not sure. Is it simple? Most definitely yes.

Few things that could be improved: random size, amount and placement of bricks to destroy - would increase replayability.
Bugs to fix some day: Ball stucks sometimes for a while on the border (if for collision is implemented multiple times making it hard for the ball to escape). Ball's speed changes (would require some advanced middle-school math to fix).
